<h1>Introduction</h1>

GDP per capita is often used as a measure of a country’s economic prosperity and growth. It can also hint at broader patterns in demographic trends. One such trend is population growth, which is influenced by a variety of economic and social factors.  

In this project, we aim to explore the relationship between a country’s GDP and its population growth rate. The main question we will be answering is: Does average GDP per capita influence a country’s average population growth rate from 2000-2019? We chose this question because we find it compelling to examine how economic well-being might affect how the population grows. This ties into debates about whether higher wealth leads to lower birth rates (as seen in developed countries) or enables higher growth (through better healthcare and living conditions).  

We find that OUR RESULTS 

<h1>Background</h1>

<h3>Data Source</h3>

<ul>
<li>Raw data: The datasets used in this analysis are collected by DataHub and sourced from the World Bank</li>
<li>The World Bank compiles data collected from various international sources, including, but not limited to, the World Bank national accounts data and OECD National Accounts data files </li>
</ul>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Country</b>: The name of the country the data refers to  </li>
<li><b>Average GDP per capita</b>: A country’s gross domestic product divided by its population for a given year, measured in current U.S. dollars. It's a widely used indicator to assess a country's standard of living and economic well-being. For this analysis, we calculate the average GDP per capita for each country across the years 2000 to 2019. </li>
<li><b>Average Population Growth</b>: The average annual percentage change in a country’s population from 2000 to 2019. It reflects the rate at which a country’s population has grown over time. This variable captures factors such as birth rates, death rates, and migration. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each row in our clean, new dataset represents the average GDP per capita and the average population growth for each country from 2000-2019.</li>
<li>We look at 217 countries in our analysis. </li>
<li>We limited our analysis to the years 2000 to 2019 for two main reasons: 
<ol>
<li>Missing Data: Several countries had incomplete or missing data for years prior to 2000, which would have made comparisons across countries inconsistent.</li>
<li>COVID-19 Pandemic: We excluded data after 2019 because the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted normal population trends due to increased mortality and changes in migration and birth rates. Including those years could have introduced unusual variation unrelated to long-term economic patterns.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
